# ðŸª»Iris Flowers Data Science Project

## Overview

The Iris Flowers Data Science Project is a comprehensive analysis and model building project using the classic Iris dataset. The primary objective is to classify different species of iris flowers based on various features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

## Contents

- `IrisFlowers.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can set up the environment using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UrSerghei/iris-flowers.git
   cd iris-flowers
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook IrisFlowers.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation processes.

3. Modify and run the code cells to explore different models and parameters.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values (if any), encode categorical features, and normalize/standardize numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable (species of iris flowers).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train different machine learning models (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines) and evaluate their performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
