# Diabetes Regression Projects

Welcome to the Diabetes Regression Projects repository! This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focusing on regression analysis for predicting diabetes-related outcomes using machine learning techniques. 


## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Predictive models can play a crucial role in understanding and managing diabetes by forecasting outcomes based on various factors. These projects utilize regression analysis to predict diabetes-related metrics, providing valuable insights for both patients and healthcare professionals.

## Notebooks

### 1. diabetes_log_regression.ipynb

This notebook focuses on logistic regression analysis for predicting diabetes onset or non-onset based on a set of features. Logistic regression is a common technique for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes.

### 2. diabetes_regression.ipynb

In this notebook, we employ regression analysis to predict continuous diabetes-related metrics such as blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, or BMI (Body Mass Index). Regression techniques allow us to estimate numerical values based on input features, providing valuable information for disease management and treatment planning.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can open the notebooks using Jupyter and execute the cells to run the analysis. 

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
