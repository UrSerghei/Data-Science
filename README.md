## Project 1: Cancer Classification

**Description:**
This project involves classifying cancer types using logistic regression. The goal is to accurately predict the presence of cancer based on various medical parameters.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Notebook:** [CancerClassification](CancerClassification)

## Project 2: House Valuations

**Description:**
This project focuses on predicting house valuations using various regression techniques. It aims to provide accurate estimates of house prices based on features like location, size, and other relevant factors.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Notebook:** [HouseValuations](HouseValuations)

## Project 3: Iris Flowers Cluster Analysis

**Description:**
This project uses cluster analysis to classify different species of iris flowers based on their features. It employs clustering algorithms to group similar data points together.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Notebook:** [IrisFlowers](IrisFlowers)

## Project 4: Movie Budget vs. Revenue

**Description:**
This project analyzes the relationship between movie budgets and their revenue. Linear regression is used to predict the revenue based on the budget and other factors.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Notebook:** [MovieBudget-Revenue(LinearRegression)](MovieBudget-Revenue(LinearRegression))

## Project 5: Nobel Prize Analysis

**Description:**
This project analyzes data related to Nobel Prize winners to identify trends and patterns. It explores various attributes such as the distribution of prizes across different categories and countries.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Notebook:** [NobelPrizeAnalysis](NobelPrizeAnalysis)

## Project 6: Diabetes Regression

**Description:**
This project involves predicting diabetes progression using regression models. Various regression techniques are applied to medical data to forecast the progression of the disease.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

**Notebooks:**
- [Diabetes Logistic Regression](diabetes_log_regression)
- [Diabetes Regression](diabetes_regression)

## Project 7: Titanic EDA

**Description:**
 This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects of the passengers onboard and their survival outcomes.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas

**Notebook:** [Titanic](titanic)
